# Placement Management System (Company Roster)
This is a placement management system designed and developed by me as a part of side college project. The project is created to ease the process of placement drives and help placement coordinators in managing the placement activities.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to provide a platform for placement coordinators to manage the placement activities, analyze the participation of students in placement drives, and track the placement process. The system features a dashboard where the placement coordinators can view the list of companies visiting the campus, the shortlisted students for each company, and the details of placement drives. One of the features in progress is the ability that allows students to register for placement drives and view the status of their application.

# How to Use the System
The placement management system is easy to use. The following steps should be followed to manage placement activities:

1. Run the application on your computer.
2. Login as a placement coordinator or a student.
3. If you are a placement coordinator, you can view the dashboard and add the details of placement drives and companies visiting the campus.
4. You can also view the list of shortlisted students for each company and analyze the participation of students in placement drives.
5. If you are a student, you can register for placement drives and view the status of your application.
